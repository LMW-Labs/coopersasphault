## When Is the Best Time to Pave Your Driveway in Oklahoma?
**Publish Date:** January 1-15
**Target Keywords:** best time to pave driveway Oklahoma, asphalt paving season, when to pave asphalt

---

Timing matters when it comes to paving your driveway. If you're thinking about a new asphalt driveway or parking lot in Central Oklahoma, understanding when conditions are ideal can mean the difference between pavement that lasts 20+ years and one that cracks within a few seasons.

### Why Temperature Matters for Asphalt

Hot mix asphalt needs specific conditions to cure properly. The material is heated to around 275-325°F during application and must cool gradually in moderate temperatures to bond correctly with the base layer.

**Ideal paving conditions:**
- Air temperature: 50°F or higher (70°F+ is optimal)
- Ground temperature: Above 50°F
- Dry conditions: No rain for at least 24 hours before and after
- Low humidity: Helps the asphalt cure properly

### Oklahoma's Prime Paving Season

For Central Oklahoma, including the OKC metro, Edmond, Moore, Norman, and surrounding areas, the best paving window typically runs from **late March through early November**.

**Spring (Late March - May):** Once temperatures consistently stay above 50°F and the ground has fully thawed, spring offers excellent paving conditions. The moderate temperatures allow for proper curing without the extreme heat of summer.

**Summer (June - August):** Summer is peak paving season. The warm temperatures keep asphalt workable longer, allowing for better compaction and smoother finishes. However, extreme heat above 95°F can make asphalt too soft, so experienced contractors schedule work for early morning starts.

**Fall (September - Early November):** Many contractors consider early fall the ideal time. Temperatures are moderate, humidity drops, and weather becomes more predictable. Paving companies are often less busy, which can mean better scheduling flexibility.

### When NOT to Pave in Oklahoma

**Winter (December - February):** While possible in emergencies, winter paving isn't recommended. Cold temperatures cause asphalt to cool too quickly, preventing proper compaction. If the ground is frozen or near-freezing, the asphalt won't bond correctly with the base.

**Rainy periods:** Even light rain prevents proper bonding and compaction. The base must be completely dry before paving begins.

### Planning Ahead

Don't wait until you're in the middle of paving season to contact contractors. The best approach is to reach out 4-6 weeks before you want work completed. This allows time for:
- Getting accurate quotes
- Scheduling around weather
- Proper preparation of your site

## Asphalt vs. Concrete: Which Is Better for Oklahoma Driveways?
**Publish Date:** January 15-30
**Target Keywords:** asphalt vs concrete driveway, best driveway material Oklahoma, asphalt or concrete which is better

---

Choosing between asphalt and concrete for your driveway is one of the biggest decisions you'll make for your property. Both materials have their advantages, but for Central Oklahoma homeowners, understanding how each performs in our climate is key.

### The Quick Comparison

| Factor | Asphalt | Concrete |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Initial Cost** | $5-$12/sq ft | $8-$18/sq ft |
| **Lifespan** | 15-30 years | 30-50 years |
| **Installation Time** | 1-2 days | 3-7 days |
| **Ready to Drive On** | 2-3 days | 7+ days |
| **Climate Performance** | Better in cold | Better in heat |
| **Maintenance** | Seal every 2-3 years | Minimal |
| **Repair Cost** | Lower | Higher |

### Why Many Oklahoma Homeowners Choose Asphalt

**1. Lower Upfront Cost**
For a typical 600-square-foot two-car driveway, asphalt costs approximately $3,000-$7,200 compared to $4,800-$10,800 for concrete. That's a significant savings for budget-conscious homeowners.

**2. Faster Installation**
Asphalt driveways can typically be driven on within 2-3 days after installation. Concrete requires at least a week to cure properly before you can use it.

**3. Easier and Cheaper Repairs**
When damage occurs, asphalt repairs are straightforward and affordable. Cracks can be filled, and damaged sections can be patched without the repair being as noticeable. Concrete repairs are more visible and expensive.

**4. Flexibility in Temperature Swings**
Oklahoma weather is unpredictable. We can see 70°F one day and freezing the next. Asphalt's flexibility allows it to expand and contract with temperature changes without cracking as easily as concrete.

**5. Better for Cold Weather**
During Oklahoma's occasional ice storms and freezing temperatures, asphalt's dark color absorbs heat from the sun, helping ice and snow melt faster than on light-colored concrete.

### When Concrete Might Be the Better Choice

Concrete has its place. Consider it if:
- You want maximum longevity and don't mind the higher upfront cost
- You prefer a lighter color for aesthetic reasons
- You want decorative options like stamping or staining
- You have a very flat property with excellent drainage

### The Climate Factor

Oklahoma's freeze-thaw cycles can be tough on concrete. Water seeps into tiny cracks, freezes, expands, and causes bigger cracks over time. While this affects asphalt too, asphalt's flexibility makes it more forgiving.

Road salt and de-icers used during winter also damage concrete surfaces more than asphalt, causing pitting and surface deterioration.

### Making Your Decision

For most Central Oklahoma homeowners, asphalt offers the best balance of cost, durability, and performance. The lower initial investment, easier maintenance, and better cold-weather performance make it a practical choice for our climate.

### Get a Professional Opinion

Every property is different. The best way to determine what's right for your specific situation is to have a professional evaluate your site, discuss your budget, and provide an honest recommendation.

## How Much Does a New Asphalt Driveway Cost in 2026?
**Publish Date:** February 1-15
**Target Keywords:** asphalt driveway cost, how much does paving cost, driveway paving prices Oklahoma

---

"How much will my new driveway cost?" It's the first question most homeowners ask, and the answer depends on several factors specific to your property and project.

Here's a straightforward breakdown of asphalt driveway costs for Central Oklahoma in 2026.

### Average Cost Ranges

**Per Square Foot:**
- Basic installation: $5-$8/sq ft
- Standard installation with good base work: $7-$12/sq ft
- Premium with enhanced base and thickness: $10-$15/sq ft

**By Driveway Size:**

| Driveway Type | Size (sq ft) | Cost Range |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Single car | 200-400 | $1,400-$4,800 |
| Two car | 400-600 | $2,800-$7,200 |
| Large/circular | 800-1,200 | $5,600-$14,400 |

The national average for a standard two-car asphalt driveway runs around $5,000-$7,000.

### What Affects Your Price

**1. Driveway Size**
This is the biggest factor. Larger driveways simply require more material and labor.

**2. Asphalt Thickness**
Residential driveways typically need 2-3 inches of asphalt. If you regularly park heavy vehicles like RVs, boats, or work trucks, you may need 4+ inches, which increases material costs.

**3. Base Preparation**
A solid foundation is critical for a long-lasting driveway. If your existing base is in poor condition or needs to be built from scratch, expect additional costs of $1-$3 per square foot for proper grading, compaction, and gravel base installation.

**4. Removal of Old Driveway**
Demolishing and hauling away an existing concrete or asphalt driveway typically adds $1-$3 per square foot.

**5. Site Conditions**
Steep grades, drainage issues, tree root removal, and difficult access all increase costs.

**6. Location**
Costs vary by region. Material and labor prices in the Oklahoma City metro are generally competitive with national averages.

### Hidden Costs to Consider

Don't forget these additional expenses when budgeting:

- **Permits:** Some municipalities require permits for driveway work ($50-$200)
- **Apron/approach:** The section connecting to the street may need repair
- **Drainage improvements:** Ensuring water flows away from your home
- **Landscaping repair:** Replacing grass or plants disturbed during work

### Ways to Save Money

**Time it right:** Scheduling during slower periods (late fall, early spring) may get you better pricing.

**Bundle services:** If your neighbor also needs paving work, contractors may offer a discount for completing multiple jobs in the same area.

**Maintain what you have:** If your current driveway's base is solid, resurfacing (applying a new layer over existing asphalt) costs $3-$7 per square foot—significantly less than full replacement.

### The Investment Perspective

A quality asphalt driveway with proper maintenance can last 20-30 years. When you compare the cost to decades of use, plus the curb appeal and property value it adds, it's a solid investment.

### Get an Accurate Quote

Online estimates can only take you so far. Every property has unique characteristics that affect the final price. The only way to get an accurate cost is to have a professional visit your property.

## 5 Signs Your Parking Lot Needs Repair Before Spring
**Publish Date:** February 15-28
**Target Keywords:** parking lot repair, asphalt damage signs, commercial parking lot maintenance

---

Winter takes a toll on asphalt parking lots. As we head toward spring, now is the time to assess your commercial property and address any damage before it gets worse—and more expensive.

Here are five warning signs that your parking lot needs attention.

### 1. Cracks Are Spreading

Small cracks might not seem like a big deal, but they're the starting point for serious damage. Water enters through cracks, freezes, expands, and makes the cracks bigger. By spring, what was a hairline crack in fall can become a network of damage.

**Types of cracks to watch for:**
- **Alligator cracking:** A pattern resembling alligator skin indicates structural failure in the base layer
- **Longitudinal cracks:** Running parallel to the pavement direction, often from poor joint construction or shrinkage
- **Edge cracks:** Along the borders of your lot, typically from inadequate drainage or base support

**What to do:** Have cracks filled and sealed before they spread. Crack sealing is one of the most cost-effective maintenance investments you can make.

### 2. Potholes Have Formed

Potholes don't appear overnight—they're the end result of untreated cracks and water damage. Once a pothole forms, it grows rapidly as vehicles drive over it and knock loose more material.

Beyond being unsightly, potholes are a liability issue. A customer or employee who trips or damages their vehicle has grounds for a lawsuit.

**What to do:** Repair potholes immediately. Temporary cold-patch repairs can be done in any weather, but permanent hot-mix repairs should be scheduled for warmer months.

### 3. Standing Water After Rain

If water pools in areas of your parking lot instead of draining away, you have a problem. Standing water accelerates asphalt deterioration and indicates one of two issues:

- **Poor initial grading:** The lot wasn't designed with proper slope for drainage
- **Settlement:** The base has shifted, creating low spots

**What to do:** Address drainage issues before they cause structural damage. Solutions range from simple surface repairs to more extensive regrading.

### 4. The Surface Has Faded to Gray

Fresh asphalt is rich black. Over time, sun exposure oxidizes the surface, turning it gray and making it brittle. A faded surface means:
- The protective oils in the asphalt have evaporated
- The pavement is more susceptible to cracking
- Water can penetrate more easily

**What to do:** Sealcoating restores the protective layer and extends pavement life by years. Most parking lots should be sealcoated every 2-3 years.

### 5. You See Loose Gravel and Aggregate

When small stones and gravel start appearing on the surface of your lot, the asphalt binder is failing. This process, called raveling, means the top layer is breaking down and wearing away.

**What to do:** If raveling is localized, patching may be sufficient. Widespread raveling often indicates the lot needs resurfacing or replacement.

### The Cost of Waiting

Every month you delay repairs, the damage gets worse and more expensive to fix:

| Issue | Repair Cost | If Ignored, Becomes |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Crack sealing | $0.50-$3/linear ft | Pothole or alligator cracking |
| Pothole patch | $50-$200 each | Larger pothole, structural damage |
| Sealcoating | $0.15-$0.30/sq ft | Oxidation, cracking, raveling |
| Drainage fix | $500-$2,000 | Base failure, major reconstruction |

### Schedule Your Spring Assessment

Don't wait for small problems to become big ones. A professional assessment can identify issues early and help you prioritize repairs within your budget.

## Spring Asphalt Maintenance Checklist for Oklahoma Property Owners
**Publish Date:** March 1-15
**Target Keywords:** asphalt maintenance checklist, spring driveway care, pavement maintenance tips

---

Spring is the ideal time to assess and maintain your asphalt surfaces. After months of winter weather, your driveway or parking lot may have developed damage that, if addressed now, can prevent costly repairs later.

Use this checklist to evaluate your asphalt and plan any needed maintenance.

### Visual Inspection Checklist

Walk your entire asphalt surface and look for:

**□ Cracks**
- Hairline cracks (less than 1/4 inch)
- Medium cracks (1/4 to 1/2 inch)
- Large cracks (over 1/2 inch)
- Alligator cracking patterns

**□ Surface Damage**
- Potholes of any size
- Depressions or low spots
- Raveling (loose aggregate on surface)
- Faded, gray appearance

**□ Drainage Issues**
- Standing water after rain
- Areas where water flows toward buildings
- Clogged or damaged drains

**□ Edge Damage**
- Crumbling edges
- Grass or weeds growing into asphalt
- Gaps between asphalt and curbs

### Recommended Spring Maintenance Actions

**1. Clean the Surface**
Remove winter debris, sand, salt residue, and leaves. A pressure washer works well for thorough cleaning. Clean surfaces help you spot damage and ensure repairs bond properly.

**2. Fill Small Cracks**
Cracks under 1/2 inch can be filled with crack sealant available at hardware stores. For larger cracks or extensive cracking, professional repair is recommended.

**3. Patch Potholes**
Small potholes can be temporarily patched with cold-patch asphalt. For lasting repairs, especially in high-traffic areas, professional hot-mix patching is the better investment.

**4. Clear Vegetation**
Pull weeds and grass growing in or along your asphalt. Their roots cause cracks to spread and edges to crumble.

**5. Check Drainage**
Ensure water flows away from your pavement and doesn't pool. Clean out any drain grates or channels.

**6. Consider Sealcoating**
If your asphalt hasn't been sealed in 2-3 years and shows signs of oxidation (gray, faded appearance), schedule sealcoating for late spring or summer.

### When to Call a Professional

Some maintenance is DIY-friendly, but certain issues require professional attention:

- Alligator cracking (indicates base failure)
- Potholes larger than a basketball
- Multiple areas of damage
- Standing water that doesn't drain
- Pavement that's soft or spongy
- Any structural concerns

### Maintenance Timeline for Oklahoma

| When | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| **March** | Initial inspection, cleaning |
| **April-May** | Crack sealing, minor repairs |
| **May-June** | Sealcoating (optimal weather) |
| **Throughout summer** | Monitor for new damage |
| **September-October** | Final sealcoating window, prep for winter |

### The ROI of Proper Maintenance

Regular maintenance dramatically extends pavement life:

- Well-maintained asphalt: 25-30 years
- Neglected asphalt: 10-15 years

A parking lot that could have been maintained for $15,000-$20,000 over its lifetime might cost $100,000+ to replace prematurely. The math is clear: maintenance pays.

## Why Potholes Form and How to Fix Them
**Publish Date:** March 15-31
**Target Keywords:** pothole repair, what causes potholes, how to fix potholes

---

Potholes are more than just annoying—they're a sign that your asphalt needs attention. Understanding why they form can help you prevent them and know when repairs are urgent.

### How Potholes Form: A Step-by-Step Process

Potholes don't appear overnight. They develop through a predictable process:

**Step 1: Water Infiltration**
It starts with water. Rain, melting snow, or poor drainage allows water to seep into the asphalt through small cracks or the pavement surface.

**Step 2: Freeze-Thaw Cycles**
When temperatures drop, water in the pavement freezes and expands. This expansion pushes the asphalt up and weakens its structure. When temperatures rise, the ice melts, leaving a gap.

**Step 3: Traffic Impact**
As vehicles drive over the weakened area, the asphalt flexes more than it should. This movement causes the surface to crack and the underlying base to shift.

**Step 4: Chunk Removal**
Eventually, pieces of asphalt break free. Vehicle tires pull loose chunks away, creating the bowl-shaped depression we call a pothole.

**Step 5: Pothole Growth**
Once a pothole forms, it expands rapidly. Water collects in the depression, accelerating damage to the surrounding asphalt.

### Why Oklahoma Is Tough on Asphalt

Central Oklahoma's climate creates ideal conditions for pothole formation:
- Frequent temperature swings (sometimes 40+ degrees in a day)
- Multiple freeze-thaw cycles each winter
- Heavy spring rains
- Summer heat that softens asphalt

### Types of Pothole Repairs

**Temporary Repairs (Cold Patch)**
- Best for emergency repairs in any weather
- Uses room-temperature asphalt mix
- Can be applied by property owners
- May last several months to a year
- Not a permanent solution

**Permanent Repairs (Hot Mix)**
- Requires temperatures above 50°F
- Uses heated asphalt for better bonding
- Includes proper cleaning and preparation
- Can match surrounding pavement life
- Professional installation recommended

**Professional Repair Process:**
1. Clean debris and water from the hole
2. Cut clean, squared edges around the damage
3. Remove loose material down to solid base
4. Apply tack coat for adhesion
5. Fill with hot mix asphalt in layers
6. Compact each layer thoroughly
7. Seal edges to prevent water infiltration

### Pothole Prevention

The best repair is prevention. Here's how to reduce pothole formation:

**Regular Sealcoating**
A sealed surface prevents water from penetrating the asphalt. Sealcoat every 2-3 years.

**Prompt Crack Repair**
Fill cracks before water can enter. This is the most cost-effective maintenance you can do.

**Proper Drainage**
Ensure water flows away from your pavement. Fix any areas where water pools.

**Quality Installation**
Potholes often form where the original installation was poor—inadequate base, thin asphalt, or improper compaction. Quality work upfront prevents problems later.

### When to Repair vs. Replace

| Situation | Recommended Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Few scattered potholes | Patch and seal |
| Many potholes, otherwise good surface | Patch, then consider resurfacing |
| Widespread damage, crumbling edges | Full replacement likely needed |
| Potholes keep returning in same area | Investigate base problems |

### The Liability Issue

For business owners: potholes are a legal liability. If someone is injured or their vehicle is damaged on your property, you could be held responsible. Document and repair potholes promptly.

### Professional Pothole Repair

For lasting repairs that match the quality of your existing pavement, professional service is worth the investment. DIY patches are good for emergencies, but they're not permanent solutions.

## What Is Sealcoating and Does Your Driveway Need It?
**Publish Date:** April 1-15
**Target Keywords:** sealcoating, driveway sealing, when to sealcoat driveway

---

If you've seen driveways or parking lots with a fresh, deep black appearance, you've seen the results of sealcoating. But what exactly is it, and does your asphalt actually need it?

### What Is Sealcoating?

Sealcoating is the application of a protective liquid layer over asphalt pavement. Think of it like sunscreen for your driveway—it creates a barrier between the asphalt and the elements.

The coating is typically made from coal tar or asphalt emulsion mixed with water, silica sand (for traction), and additives. When applied properly and allowed to cure, it forms a protective skin over the asphalt surface.

### What Sealcoating Does

**1. Protects Against UV Damage**
Sun exposure causes asphalt to oxidize, turning it gray and brittle. Sealcoating blocks UV rays, slowing this process significantly.

**2. Prevents Water Penetration**
Water is asphalt's biggest enemy. Sealcoating fills tiny surface cracks and creates a waterproof barrier that prevents moisture from reaching the base layer.

**3. Resists Oil and Chemical Damage**
Vehicle fluids—oil, gasoline, antifreeze—can soften and damage unprotected asphalt. Sealcoating provides resistance to these chemicals.

**4. Restores Appearance**
Fresh sealcoating brings back that rich, dark black color that makes asphalt look new. This improves curb appeal and property value.

**5. Extends Pavement Life**
Regular sealcoating can double the life of your pavement by protecting it from the elements that cause deterioration.

### Does Your Driveway Need Sealcoating?

**Signs you need sealcoating:**
- Asphalt has faded from black to gray
- Surface feels rough or shows small cracks
- It's been 2-3 years since last sealcoating
- You can see individual aggregate stones on the surface

**When NOT to sealcoat:**
- New asphalt (wait 6-12 months for curing)
- Pavement with major structural damage (repair first)
- During cold weather (below 50°F)
- When rain is expected within 24-48 hours

### The Sealcoating Process

**Preparation:**
1. Clean surface of all dirt, debris, and vegetation
2. Remove oil and grease stains with degreaser
3. Fill cracks with crack filler (wait for it to cure)
4. Repair any potholes or damaged areas

**Application:**
1. Apply sealcoat with spray equipment or squeegee
2. Apply in thin, even coats
3. Allow first coat to dry (usually 4-8 hours)
4. Apply second coat if needed
5. Allow 24-48 hours before driving on surface

### Professional vs. DIY Sealcoating

| Factor | DIY | Professional |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Cost | $100-$200 materials | $400-$600+ for typical driveway |
| Equipment | Basic squeegee | Commercial spray equipment |
| Coverage | Uneven | Consistent |
| Durability | 1-2 years | 2-3+ years |
| Time | Full day + waiting | Done in hours |

While DIY sealcoating is possible, professional application typically lasts longer and looks better. Commercial equipment provides more even coverage, and professionals know how to prep the surface properly.

### Sealcoating Frequency

**Residential driveways:** Every 2-3 years
**Commercial parking lots:** Every 1-2 years (higher traffic)
**New asphalt:** First sealcoat 6-12 months after installation

### Sealcoating Costs

| Property Type | Cost Range |
|---------------|------------|
| Residential driveway (400-600 sq ft) | $200-$500 |
| Two-car driveway (600-800 sq ft) | $400-$700 |
| Commercial parking lot | $0.15-$0.30/sq ft |

### Common Sealcoating Mistakes

- Applying too thick (leads to cracking and peeling)
- Sealcoating over damaged pavement (won't fix underlying problems)
- Applying in bad weather (won't cure properly)
- Driving on it too soon (causes tracking and damage)
- Skipping the cleaning step (sealcoat won't adhere)

### The Bottom Line

Sealcoating is one of the most cost-effective ways to protect your asphalt investment. For a fraction of the cost of replacement, you can add years to your pavement's life and keep it looking great.

## How Long Does an Asphalt Driveway Last?
**Publish Date:** April 15-30
**Target Keywords:** asphalt driveway lifespan, how long does asphalt last, driveway replacement timing

---

When you invest in an asphalt driveway, you want to know: how long will it last? The answer depends on several factors, but understanding them helps you maximize your investment.

### Average Asphalt Lifespan

**With proper maintenance:** 25-30 years
**Without maintenance:** 10-15 years

That's a significant difference. The same driveway that could serve you for three decades might need replacement in half that time if neglected.

### Factors That Affect Longevity

**1. Installation Quality**
This is the biggest factor. A driveway with:
- Properly prepared and compacted base
- Adequate asphalt thickness (2-3 inches minimum)
- Professional-grade materials
- Correct installation temperature and technique

...will far outlast a poorly installed one, regardless of maintenance.

**2. Climate Conditions**
Oklahoma's weather is tough on asphalt:
- Temperature extremes cause expansion and contraction
- Freeze-thaw cycles crack and heave pavement
- Intense summer sun oxidizes the surface
- Heavy spring rains test drainage

**3. Traffic Load**
Consider what drives on your driveway:
- Standard passenger vehicles: Normal wear
- Heavy trucks, RVs, trailers: Accelerated wear
- Frequent traffic: More wear than occasional use

**4. Maintenance Habits**
Regular maintenance dramatically extends life:
- Sealcoating every 2-3 years
- Prompt crack filling
- Quick pothole repairs
- Keeping surface clean

**5. Drainage**
Water is asphalt's enemy. Driveways with:
- Proper slope away from structures
- No standing water
- Good edge drainage

...last longer than those where water pools or flows toward the pavement.

### Timeline: What to Expect at Each Stage

**Years 0-2: The Curing Period**
Your new driveway continues to cure and harden. Avoid sharp turns in the same spot, don't park heavy equipment in one place, and stay off during extreme heat. Schedule first sealcoating around month 6-12.

**Years 2-10: Prime Years**
With maintenance, your driveway should look great and perform well. Sealcoat every 2-3 years, fill any cracks promptly, and address drainage issues immediately.

**Years 10-15: Watch Period**
Even well-maintained driveways start showing age. You may see:
- More frequent crack development
- Surface becoming rougher
- Gray appearance returns faster after sealcoating

Continue maintenance, but budget for more repairs.

**Years 15-20: Decision Time**
Evaluate whether continued repairs are cost-effective. Consider:
- Resurfacing (new layer over existing) if base is solid
- Replacement if structural problems exist

**Years 20-30: Extended Life**
Well-maintained driveways can reach this age, but plan for replacement in your future budget.

### Signs Your Driveway Is Aging Out

- Alligator cracking (interconnected cracks like scales)
- Multiple potholes that keep returning
- Large areas of crumbling or raveling
- Soft or spongy spots
- Significant drainage problems
- Repairs are becoming frequent and expensive

### Maximizing Your Driveway's Life

**Do:**
- Sealcoat on schedule
- Fill cracks when you see them
- Fix potholes immediately
- Clean oil spills promptly
- Keep edges clear of grass and weeds
- Maintain proper drainage

**Don't:**
- Ignore small problems
- Use sharp objects on the surface
- Park heavy equipment in one spot
- Let water pool
- Use harsh chemicals near pavement
- Wait until spring to address winter damage

### When Repair Beats Replacement

| Situation | Recommended Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Surface worn but base is solid | Resurfacing ($3-$7/sq ft) |
| Scattered cracks and small potholes | Repair and seal |
| Edge crumbling only | Edge repair |
| Fade but no structural damage | Sealcoating |

### When Replacement Is the Answer

| Situation | Why Replacement Is Needed |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Widespread alligator cracking | Base has failed |
| Potholes keep returning | Structural problems |
| Driveway sinks or heaves | Foundation issues |
| More than 50% needs repair | Repair costs exceed replacement |
| Driveway is 25+ years old with major issues | End of useful life |

### Your Driveway Assessment

- Current condition and remaining life
- What repairs would extend its use
- When replacement should be planned
- Estimated costs for each option
