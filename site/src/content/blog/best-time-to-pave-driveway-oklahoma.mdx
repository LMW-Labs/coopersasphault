Timing matters when it comes to paving your driveway. If you're thinking about a new asphalt driveway or parking lot in Central Oklahoma, understanding when conditions are ideal can mean the difference between pavement that lasts 20+ years and one that cracks within a few seasons.

## Why Temperature Matters for Asphalt

Hot mix asphalt needs specific conditions to cure properly. The material is heated to around 275-325°F during application and must cool gradually in moderate temperatures to bond correctly with the base layer.

**Ideal paving conditions:**
- Air temperature: 50°F or higher (70°F+ is optimal)
- Ground temperature: Above 50°F
- Dry conditions: No rain for at least 24 hours before and after
- Low humidity: Helps the asphalt cure properly

## Oklahoma's Prime Paving Season

For Central Oklahoma, including the OKC metro, Edmond, Moore, Norman, and surrounding areas, the best paving window typically runs from **late March through early November**.

### Spring (Late March - May)

Once temperatures consistently stay above 50°F and the ground has fully thawed, spring offers excellent paving conditions. The moderate temperatures allow for proper curing without the extreme heat of summer.

### Summer (June - August)

Summer is peak paving season. The warm temperatures keep asphalt workable longer, allowing for better compaction and smoother finishes. However, extreme heat above 95°F can make asphalt too soft, so experienced contractors schedule work for early morning starts.

### Fall (September - Early November)

Many contractors consider early fall the ideal time. Temperatures are moderate, humidity drops, and weather becomes more predictable. Paving companies are often less busy, which can mean better scheduling flexibility.

## When NOT to Pave in Oklahoma

### Winter (December - February)

While possible in emergencies, winter paving isn't recommended. Cold temperatures cause asphalt to cool too quickly, preventing proper compaction. If the ground is frozen or near-freezing, the asphalt won't bond correctly with the base.

### Rainy Periods

Even light rain prevents proper bonding and compaction. The base must be completely dry before paving begins.

## Planning Ahead

Don't wait until you're in the middle of paving season to contact contractors. The best approach is to reach out 4-6 weeks before you want work completed. This allows time for:

- Getting accurate quotes
- Scheduling around weather
- Proper preparation of your site

## Maintaining Your New Driveway

Once your driveway is installed, proper maintenance will extend its life significantly:

1. **Wait before sealing**: Your new driveway needs 6-12 months to cure before the first sealcoat
2. **Avoid sharp turns**: Don't turn your steering wheel while stopped for the first few months
3. **Keep it clean**: Remove debris and clean oil spills promptly
4. **Schedule sealcoating**: Every 2-3 years to protect the surface
